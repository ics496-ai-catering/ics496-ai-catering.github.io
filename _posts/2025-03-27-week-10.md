### 1. Deployment Environment Migration

* **Issue:** Vercel builds broke after the repo was made private, since organizational private deployments require a Pro plan.
* **Solution:** Switched our Next.js deployment to Cloudflare Workers using the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter.
* **Outcome:** CI/CD pipeline restored—every push now successfully builds and deploys our app on Cloudflare.

### 2. Front‑End Enhancements

Rather than enumerating individual commits, here’s what landed on Mar 27:

* **Improved order‑tracking sidebar** with a new close (“×”) control so users can hide or reveal their current order panel at will.
* **Enhanced order list management** by adding a “remove item” button, letting users delete selections without navigating away.

### 3. Next Steps (Week 11)

1. Continue building out AI recommendation mockups and integrate with live data.
2. Begin user testing on the updated order sidebar interactions.
