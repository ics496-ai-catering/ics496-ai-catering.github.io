### Project Overview: AI-Based Catering Service Matching System

We are developing an intelligent AI-powered platform that matches clients with the best catering services for their events. Whether you're planning a wedding, corporate gathering, or social celebration, this system will consider your unique requirements, preferences, and constraints to recommend the ideal catering options.

### Key Features:

#### 1. **Intelligent Event Profiling**
   - **Event Type Classification**: Identifying the type of event (wedding, corporate, social, etc.)
   - **Guest Count & Demographics**: Gathering information on the number of guests and their specific needs.
   - **Venue Compatibility**: Matching the caterer to the event's location and its space constraints.
   - **Budget Optimization**: Ensuring the selected catering services fit within the userâ€™s budget.
   - **Dietary Requirements Handling**: Accommodating any dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, etc.)

#### 2. **Recommendation Engine**
   - **Machine Learning-Based Matching**: Using historical data and machine learning to provide the best match between clients and caterers.
   - **Historical Event Success Scoring**: Leveraging past event data to score and recommend based on success rates.
   - **Seasonal Menu Optimization**: Suggesting menus that are in season for better freshness and cost-effectiveness.
   - **Dietary Restriction Compatibility Scoring**: Matching menus that align with specific dietary needs (e.g., gluten-free, vegan).
   - **Adventurousness**: Assessing whether the client is open to trying new or exotic dishes. This could potentially be left to the caterers to provide.
   - **Kitchen Constraints**: Ensuring the catering service can meet specific kitchen or time constraints.
   - **Presentation/Serving Recommendations**: Offering suggestions on how to serve or present food to enhance the event experience.

#### 3. **User Interface**
   - **Event Requirement Questionnaire**: Gathering detailed information about the event (e.g., number of guests, servers, type of event).
   - **Interactive Budget Calculator**: Letting users input their budget and adjust to see what they can afford based on their preferences.
     - For example: "You have $15 per person; here are some options that fit within your budget." Users can tweak the selection and see how the budget changes.
   - **Menu Preview and Customization**: Allowing users to preview available menu items and customize them.
   - **Real-Time Availability Checking**: Ensuring caterers are available for the event date and time.
   - **Automated Proposal Generation**: Automatically generating a proposal based on the client's inputs, showcasing caterers, menus, and costs.

### System Integration

The platform will be integrated into the existing catering app [catering.daspot.net](https://catering.daspot.net/), leveraging historical data and expert input for model training. 

There will also be an upselling feature where clients will be encouraged to explore additional offerings that are commonly purchased with the selected menu items.

### Next Steps: Actionables & User Stories

1. **Create Initial User Stories**:
   - **Scenario 1**: A client unsure of what they want but open to suggestions. They will go through a guided process with questions to discover the best options.
   - **Scenario 2**: A client with a clear idea of what they want but is looking for alternatives or recommendations.
   - **Scenario 3**: A client with very specific requirements (e.g., dietary restrictions, budget constraints). The system will provide suggestions that fit within these limitations.
   - *Roadmap created on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ics496-ai-catering/projects/1), which will be updated regularly throughout the project.*

2. **Identify Necessary Data and Tech Stack**:
   - What data will be required to fuel the recommendation engine (e.g., client preferences, historical event data, caterer availability)?
     - Acquire a copy of the relevant tables in the database that could be used for the recommendation engine.
     - An UML diagram of the entire database could also be helpful in identifying the data that could be utilized.
     - *Note: We do not want direct access to their database servers, a clone without PII would be preferred.*
   - What tech stack do we need for integration with the current website?
     - Otherwise, a separate website will be developed with NextJS.

3. **User Interface Considerations**:
   - Do we want a chatbot, form, or both for gathering user preferences?
     - We believe a form would be better for gathering all required event details in a simple, structured way.
     - We could create a basic survey and ask some people around school to see what they prefer.
   - What will the interface look like for each user story (e.g., for Scenario 1, how do we make the discovery process easy and engaging)?
