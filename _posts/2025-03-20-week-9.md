### 1. Database & Asset Access

* **CSV dump received**: Daspot delivered two files—`catering_requests.csv` (orders from 2017 through early 2020) and `food.csv` (available menu items).
* **GCS bucket pending**: Requested access to the images bucket and the missing menu‑set data.

---

### 2. Data Wrangling & Exploration

* **Schema issues uncovered**: The CSV violated first‑normal‑form (repeating groups and redundant fields), leading to duplicated and inconsistent entries.
* **Cleaning work**:

  * Identified and collapsed repeated information
  * Imputed or removed NaNs and corrected malformed cells
  * Established a canonical list of menu items and standardized request records

---

### 3. Front‑End Integration

With cleaned CSVs in hand, we began wiring real data into our UI:

* Swapped out the fake‑data JSON for `food.csv` feeds
* Ensured the date/time picker now nests properly (time picker inside date picker) for streamlined input
* Surfaced the “View Order” control across all tabs and added a persistent order‑tracking sidebar

---

### 4. Summary of Development Efforts

Rather than listing each commit, here’s what the team accomplished on Mar 18–19:

* Migrated from mock JSON to live CSV data sources
* Enhanced the order form UX by embedding time selection within the date picker
* Rolled out a sidebar that continuously displays the user’s current order
* Extended “View Order” functionality to every section of the menu
* Addressed and resolved emergent errors to stabilize the new data flow

### 5. Next Steps (Week 9)

1. **Finalize GCS access** and link item images in the menu carousel.
2. **Normalize and import** the cleaned CSVs into PostgreSQL via our Next.js API routes.
3. **Begin exploratory analysis** on historical request patterns to inform AI recommendation logic.
4. **Build menu‑set management** UI once those data tables become available.
