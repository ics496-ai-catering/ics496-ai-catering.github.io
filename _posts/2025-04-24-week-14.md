### 1. Chatbot & Recommender API

* **FastAPI server** spun up to expose both the Gemini 2.0 Flash–powered chatbot and the PySpark ALS recommender via REST endpoints.
* **RAG pipeline** built on Vertex AI: we ingested every menu and food item as text files into GCS, then used Google’s RAG engine to index that content for on‑the‑fly LLM retrieval.
* **Asset management note:** images remain named by food label—still plan a more robust ID‑mapping strategy.

### 2. Deployment Migration

* **Bundle‑size cliff:** adding Vercel’s AI package pushed the gzipped frontend above 5 MB, breaking our Cloudflare Workers setup.
* **New home:** relocated the Next.js site to Google Cloud Run and deployed the FastAPI chatbot on a Compute Engine VM. CI/CD is restored and performance is stable.

### 3. Front‑End & UX Enhancements

Over Apr 19–24 the UI saw a flurry of polish:

* **Chatbot integration:** switched from Vercel’s ai‑sdk to our own chat component, fixed layout shifts, disabled file uploads, and preserved chat history across tabs. Improved sizing and added toasts for feedback.
* **Order customization:** paginated the “Customize Orders” screen, surfaced upsell suggestions, and added loading/selected‑menu states.
* **Sidebar & modals:** introduced a confirmation dialog on form submission, a close button on item‑card popups, and patched several form‑validation and build errors.
* **Bundle slimming:** removed faker and unused AI packages to reclaim bytes.

### 4. Next Steps (Week 15)

1. Wire chatbot and recommender calls into the UI—display LLM answers and “You Might Like” suggestions contextually.
2. Migrate image filenames to an ID‑based manifest for long‑term maintainability.
3. Load‑test the Cloud Run + FastAPI setup and configure autoscaling thresholds.
4. Begin A/B testing of RAG‑driven menu assistance vs. static forms to measure user engagement.
