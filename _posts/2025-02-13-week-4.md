### 1. Architecture & Integration

* **Framework‑agnostic catering service**

  * Must plug into any database or website (though for now we’ll focus on Daspot)
  * Data‑mapping layer will normalize disparate schemas; effort scales with structural differences
* **Next steps:** draft data‑adapter interface and define minimal required data model
* This is a future idea, so it is not required to be implemented at the moment.

### 2. User Flow & UI Concepts

**Goal:** ultra‑simple, “free‑flowing” ordering in as few clicks as possible

* **Adaptive form (“procedural flow”)**

  * Questions evolve based on previous answers
  * Two parallel paths:

    1. **Historical‑based** recommendations (for repeat customers who “log in” via contact info)
    2. **Global‑based** recommendations (for one‑time/anonymous users)
  * Login is optional; most new users will skip, repeat customers are more likely to provide info
* **Information prioritization**

  * Upfront: only absolutely necessary fields (e.g. food selection)
  * Defer: location, event time, detailed catering logistics (food handling, staffing, music, etc.)
  * Sidebar/filter panel for secondary attributes (budget, cuisine type, upsell options)
* **UX experiments:**

  * Dropdown to reveal advanced options
  * Audio‑driven interface (longer‑term)

**Next steps:**

1. Sketch two flow diagrams (historical vs. global)
2. Define “must‑ask” vs. “can‑ask‑later” field sets
3. Prototype a minimal adaptive form

### 3. Recommendation Logic & Feature Engineering

* **Dual recommendation engines**

  1. **Personalized** — leverages user’s past orders
  2. **Collaborative/global** — trends from all users
* **Contextual adjustments**

  * Distance-based: de‑prioritize raw‑fish or perishables when delivery radius is large
  * Budget sensitivity:

    * If “unlimited,” surface premium items, not the cheapest
    * If constrained, highlight value offerings
* **Upsell opportunities:** dessert stations, beverage packages, staffing (waiters, music/DJ)

**Next steps:**

* Inventory relevant features in Daspot’s database (order history, event types, location data)
* Draft initial feature list for model training (e.g. cuisine × distance × budget)

### 4. Budget & Cost Estimation

* Historical spend data → baseline cost estimates by event type
* Dynamic estimator that refines as more fields are entered

**Next steps:** build simple cost‑estimation algorithm using past invoices

### 5. Open Questions & Risks

| Topic               | Question / Risk                                           | Mitigation                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data heterogeneity  | How different are external clients’ schemas?              | Build flexible adapter, plan for manual mapping initially              |
| User friction       | Will an adaptive form still feel like “too much” upfront? | Conduct quick usability tests on form prototypes                       |
| Food‑handling rules | What regulations apply by distance/region?                | Consult catering operations team; encode rules in recommendation logic |
| Audio UI            | Feasible within project timeline?                         | Research third‑party speech‑UI libraries; defer to phase 2             |

**Action items for next week**

1. Draft and review flow diagrams (Product & UX)
2. Define data‑adapter interface and minimal schema (Engineering)
3. Prototype cost estimator using historical data (Data Science)
4. Plan usability test for adaptive form (UX Research)
