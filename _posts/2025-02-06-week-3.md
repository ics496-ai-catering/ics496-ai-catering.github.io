## Recap of Previous Week  

### Draft Form Questions

First, we looked at the existing questions that the website asks. This is the list that we extracted from the website:

```
1) What type of event do you need catering for?
  - Wedding
  - Birthday
  - Film Set
  - Party
  - Other
2) How many people are you ordering for?
3) When do you need your catering? mm/dd/yyyy
4) What time do you need your catering?
5) Tentative budget per person? 
  - Less than 10
  - 10-15
  - 15-20
  - 20-25
  - Other
6) Address of your event for delivery
7) Do you need any other services other than food?
  - Tents
  - Serving staff
  - Entertainment
  - Delivery
8) (Free-Form) Tell us about the event you need catering for, food allergies, delivery specifications, concerns.
```

We noted that the free-form question is asked AFTER being asked to select your food items. Our form should ask this BEFORE they create their order, so we can also filter out foods that have allergens.

Then, we revamped the questions and added our own to meet the new requirements:

```
1) What type of event do you need catering for?
  - Wedding
  - Birthday
  - Film Set
  - Party
  - Other (free form to specify)
2) What style of service do you want?
  - Buffet
  - Dining
  - Other
3) How many people are you ordering for?
4) Are there any restrictions on food allergies?
  - Very important! This would probably be a complete block out of certain categories.
5) Are there any dietary restrictions?
  - Gluten-free
  - Vegan
  - Other
6) (if #5) Are all guests gluten-free, vegan, etc, or just a few out of X?
  - This way, the recommendation engine can determine a good balance to accommodate everyone.
7) What is the address of the event location?
8) Add an additional field here if there are special delivery instructions, i.e. passcode entry, enter through the back, etc.
9) Any concerns or constraints about this location? 
  - i.g. it will be in an open field, will probably be sunny and hot, if we have sushi, make sure the plates are properly cooled and we should probably bring extra ice.
10) What date and time do you need the catering? 
  - Have some way to check whether there is enough staff on this day to handle the order?
11) What is your budget?
  - Unsure? Click here to open our budget calculator üôÇ
  - If there‚Äôs tiers of food, or general price range of food. 
  - Is there data on how many servings is given per order? So we can calculate this in budget.
  - Actually, the website doesn‚Äôt even show how much each food item costs‚Ä¶ ü§î
12) Do you need any other services other than food?
  - Tents ‚Üí how many?
  - Serving staff ‚Üí how many? Is serving staff just to serve food, or also other responsibilities?
  - Entertainment ‚Üí what kind do you want, and what kinds are available?
  - Delivery
  - Note: does this affect the budget? How much? Tables, utensils, etc. are also other services that might be needed.
13) Fun section?
  - Set an ‚Äúadventurousness‚Äù score for food.
  - Presentation requests (on a cool wooden boat? etc. add to cost).
```

Then, given this input, we can generate some proposal. 

#### Proposal Generation & Customization  

1) **AI-Recommended Proposals**  
   - Customers receive a few automatically generated proposals based on their preferences and past data.  
   - These proposals can be customized by the customer afterwards to better fit their needs.  
   - If possible, provide a brief explanation for each recommendation (e.g., "Recommended based on your past orders" or "Popular choice for similar events").  

2Ôºâ**Manual Selection Option**  
   - Customers can build their own proposal from scratch.  
   - The available options are pre-filtered based on dietary restrictions and allergies to streamline the selection process.  

3Ôºâ**Intelligent Upselling**  
   - After finalizing a selection, customers can receive upsell suggestions.  
   - These are based on historical purchase patterns (e.g., "Customers who ordered X also added Y").  

#### First-Page Mockup

#### Possible Website Improvements

- The current website appears to be built on **WordPress**, as indicated by keyword analysis from inspecting the site‚Äôs elements.  
- The **Catering Page** has several areas for improvement to enhance user experience. Suggested improvements:

1) **Detailed Food Pop-ups**  
- Add pop-ups with food descriptions to help users better understand menu items.  
- While this data may not be available yet, adding it in the future could enhance the **recommendation engine** (e.g., allowing customers to search for ‚Äúcreamy and refreshing‚Äù dishes in natural language.

2Ôºâ**Improve Preset Menu Details**  
- The preset menu currently lacks detail compared to the **self-order menu**.  
- Adding more descriptions and images can improve clarity and customer decision-making.

3Ôºâ**Revamp Order Labels**  
- Some menu items display ‚Äú0 orders,‚Äù which may discourage customers from choosing them.  
- Instead, popular items could be labeled as **‚ÄúTRENDING‚Äù** or **‚ÄúHOT‚Äù**, while other items remain unmarked.

### Draft Emails to contacts

- We created a shared Google Doc to draft emails to the tech contact, and the owner.
- We sent out an email to the tech contact to request database access, but we're holding out on contacting the owner at the moment until we have something more concrete to show.

## Next Steps: Actionables

- TODO...
