### 1. Database Submission & Cart Management

* **Persisting orders:** Backend insert logic is now live—form submissions write directly into PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM.
* **UX tweak:** Removed the extra DB call on submission and reset the cart state immediately after an order is placed to avoid duplicate writes and clear the UI.

---

### 2. Upsell & Search Features

* **Upsell integration:** Users can now add suggested upsell items directly from the recommendation list into their current order.
* **Item search:** Introduced a client‑side search box on the items list for quick filtering by name or category.
* **Empty‑recommendations handling:** Gracefully shows a “no recommendations” message when the ALS engine returns nothing.

### 3. Infrastructure & DevOps

* **Drizzle & migrations:** Finalized database migrations to adjust column schemas and wired up Drizzle configuration (including `.env` loading).
* **Dockerization:** Added a Dockerfile for both the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI backend to standardize development and production environments.

### 4. Next Steps (Week 16)

1. **Performance testing:** Benchmark API response times and frontend load under simulated user traffic.
2. **Monitoring & alerts:** Set up logging, metrics, and alerting for both application and database layers.
