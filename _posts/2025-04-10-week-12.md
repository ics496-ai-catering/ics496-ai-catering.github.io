### 1. Image & Menu‑Set Data Ingestion

* **GCS bucket unlocked**: We now have the full library of food‑item images. Filenames mirror the food names (no numeric IDs), which is nonstandard but workable—flagged for future discussions on asset‑management improvements.
* **Menu‑set data received**: Completed, giving us the categorical groupings needed for preset‑menu displays and filtering.

### 2. Front‑End Adjustments

Throughout Apr 8–10, the team rolled out subtle but impactful UI refinements:

* Refreshed the **item‑card design** to better showcase images and pricing.
* Corrected broken **food‑image URLs** so that each card reliably renders its photo.
* Implemented a **temporary randomization** of images to stress‑test the carousel and grid layouts until final mappings are confirmed.

### 3. Next Steps (Week 13)

1. **Finalize image mapping**: Align each food record with its exact GCS filename and retire the random fallback.
2. **Menu‑set integration**: Surface preset menus in the UI, allowing users to filter or browse by set.
3. **Asset‑management review**: Propose a strategy for ID‑based filenames or manifest files to streamline future data syncs.
4. **Begin recommender UI**: Wire up the first AI‑question prototypes to drive personalized suggestions using our cleaned data.
