### 1. Tech Stack Selection

* **Next.js**

  * Server‑rendered React framework for fast initial page loads and SEO benefits
  * Built‑in routing, API routes, and image optimization streamline development
* **PostgreSQL**

  * Reliable relational database with rich indexing and JSON‑column support
  * Prepares us for production‑grade data storage once Daspot integration begins
* **shadcn (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS primitives)**

  * Provides unstyled, accessible UI components from Radix UI that we can fully customize via Tailwind
  * Ensures high accessibility standards (keyboard/navigation, ARIA) out of the box while matching our design system
* **Tailwind CSS**

  * Utility‑first styling for rapid, consistent UI development
  * Eliminates custom CSS bloat and keeps style definitions co‑located with markup

> **Significance of shadcn/Radix UI:** by combining Radix’s robust, accessible component primitives with shadcn’s Tailwind‑friendly wrappers, we get both rock‑solid accessibility and the flexibility to style every component to our needs—without reinventing low‑level interactions.

### 2. Key Frontend Features Implemented

| Feature             | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Navbar**          | Responsive top navigation with mobile‑friendly hamburger menu and dynamic link highlighting |
| **Item Info Modal** | Basic modal overlay showing food‑item details; ready for dynamic data injection             |
| **Pagination**      | Client‑side pagination component to navigate long lists of items efficiently                |
| **Carousel**        | Image carousel for featured items or promotions, built with shadcn slider primitives        |

### 3. Fake‑Data Generation Script

* **Why:** Daspot’s real data isn’t available yet, but frontend components need realistic inputs to validate layouts and interactions.
* **How:**

  * Used **faker.js** to generate 500 mock food items with fields such as name, description, price, image URL, category, and availability.
  * Output written to a local JSON file and seeded into PostgreSQL for immediate use.
* **Next steps:** swap in Daspot’s real API endpoints once ready; the data‑layer abstraction will make this a simple configuration change.

### 4. Next Steps

1. **Connect to Backend API stub**

   * Replace fake‑data JSON with Next.js API routes that mimic Daspot’s eventual responses.
2. **Enhance Item Modal**

   * Add “Add to Cart” and “Favorite” actions; wire up state management (e.g. React Context or Zustand).
3. **Styling & Theming**

   * Flesh out global Tailwind theme (colors, typography) to align with brand guidelines.
