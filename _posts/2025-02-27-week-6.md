### 1. Event & Contact Forms

* **Form implementation**

  * Built an event‑info page and contact‑details page using shadcn’s Form primitives and React Hook Form
  * Inputs wired to component state; real‑time validation feedback
* **Validation schema**

  * Employed Zod to define and enforce input schemas (e.g. required fields, date‑range constraints, email format)
  * Integrated with React Hook Form resolver for seamless error handling

> **Note:** Submission logic to persist data in the database will follow once backend endpoints are available.

### 2. Date & Time Picker

* Integrated shadcn’s DatePicker and TimePicker components
* Connected pickers to form state and Zod validation (e.g. event date ≥ today, time within business hours)

### 3. Secure Database Connectivity Setup

* **Requirement:** Daspot requires whitelisted IPs for direct database access
* **Solution:**

  1. Provisioned an Oracle Cloud VM
  2. Installed and configured Tailscale VPN server on the VM
  3. Shared the VM’s Tailscale‑assigned IP address with Daspot for whitelisting
* **Status:** Awaiting confirmation of DB access from Daspot

### 4. Next Steps

1. **DB Submission Logic**

   * Implement API routes in Next.js to POST form data into PostgreSQL once access is granted
2. **State Persistence**

   * Introduce local persistence (e.g. `localStorage` or React Query’s cache) to preserve in‑progress forms
3. **Error Handling & UX**

   * Design user feedback for connection failures or validation errors during submission
4. **Security Review**

   * Validate VPN setup, ensure least‑privilege access, plan for secrets management
