### Recap of Previous Week  

- Created initial user stories, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ics496-ai-catering/projects/1).  
- Launched project website to post updates.

### Next Steps: Actionables & User Stories

- Request read-only database access. To protect customer privacy, personally identifiable information (e.g., emails, addresses) should be excluded from access, as it is not needed for the recommendation engine.  
- Send emails to the tech contact (for database access) and the owner of DaSpot to discuss the project further.  
- Design a mock-up of the event profiling form based on the requirements.
