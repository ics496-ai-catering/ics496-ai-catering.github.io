### 1. Database Access

We’ve shared our Tailscale VPN server IP with Daspot and are now awaiting whitelist approval. Once granted, we’ll switch from faker.js to live PostgreSQL queries.

### 2. Front‑End Progress

Our initial milestone was to replicate the original site’s functionality and layout. With that foundation in place, here’s what we delivered:

* **Robust UI scaffolding**:

  * Loading states on the “Add” button clearly signal in‑flight actions
  * Console warnings eliminated for a cleaner development experience
* **Interactive menu & ordering**:

  * Clickable menu tabs with support for multiple menu sets
  * “More info” modals for individual items, complete with images
  * State persistence across form sections, so in‑progress orders aren’t lost
* **Enhanced navigation & forms**:

  * Additional navigation buttons and tab structure aligned with original design
  * Integrated date/time pickers tied into form validation

### 3. Next Steps & UI Improvements

1. **Elevate Order‑Method Tabs**

   * Convert to large, image‑driven cards matching the original site’s style
   * Ensure responsive behavior and accessible focus states
2. **Current Order Panel**

   * Introduce a sidebar component that displays the user’s selections in real time
3. **AI Recommendation Mockups**

   * Draft question flows for both historical‑based and global recommendations
   * Build static mockup pages using shadcn form primitives
4. **Database Integration**

   * On IP whitelist approval, implement Next.js API routes to persist and fetch event/contact data
